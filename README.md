# Intro
This is a quick repo / self-reference "wiki" of sorts (more info will be added to the 'Wiki' for this repo!
  
# What is the Intune PowerShell SDK
It's a list of PowerShell cmdlets that connect directly to the Intune Graph API and lets you perform actions remotely via PowerShell instead of directly via Graph. 
  
# Getting Started
## Setup
 - Install the Microsoft.Graph.Intune module the direct repo [here](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Microsoft.Graph.Intune)
 - Alternatively, you can run this from a PowerShell session that you ran as Admin using a single command.
```PowerShell
Install-Module -Name Microsoft.Graph.Intune
```
